Steps in this Machine learning Model 

1. Data Collection
2. Data Pre-processing
• Outlier Treatment
• Missing value imputation
• Variable transformation
3. Model training using 3 types of Methods: 
+ Logistic regression
+ Linear Discriminant Analysis 
+ K-Nearest Neighbors (n=3) 
• Test-Train Split
• Use template to train
• Do iterations
• Compare performance of different methods using test set
4. Select the best model
• For prediction purposes use model with best accuracy
• For interpretation purposes look at the coefficient values of parametric
models 

RESULTS 
By comparing three models with accuracy % 

+ Logistic regression = 65%
+ Linear Discriminant Analysis  = 66.6%
+ K-Nearest Neighbors (n=3)  = 55%

Conclusion

I believe this model could be optimized and tuned more to add accuracy either by adding new features or engineering new features. This model can be used to predict the house prices in any geographic location by just slightly fine tuning the features and parameters.
What would be more interesting in my view is; if we could add second layer to the model output or may be second step where results from this model are fed into second model which would then forecast district house prices 6 months, 18 months and so on into the future. This would allow the opportunity not only to predict the house prices but also to see what the future holds for the house prices. And this is exactly the type of insights Real Estate Investment teams need to make right investments.
