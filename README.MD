Steps in this Machine learning Model 

 Data Collection
 Data Pre-processing
• Outlier Treatment
• Missing value imputation
• Variable transformation
 Model training Suing 3 types of Methods: 
+ Logistic regression
+ Linear Discriminant Analysis 
+ K-Nearest Neighbors (n=3) 
• Test-Train Split
• Use template to train
• Do iterations
• Compare performance of different methods using test set
 Select the best model
• For prediction purposes use model with best accuracy
• For interpretation purposes look at the coefficient values of parametric
models 

RESULTS 
By comparing three models with accuracy % 

+ Logistic regression = 65%
+ Linear Discriminant Analysis  = 66.6%
+ K-Nearest Neighbors (n=3)  = 55%
